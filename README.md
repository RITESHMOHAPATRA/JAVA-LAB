present in it.
42. Write a Program in Java to fill a 2-D array with the first m x n prime numbers, where m is

The words are to be separated by a single blank space. Print an error message if the input
does not terminate with “.” or “?”. You can assume that no word in the sentence exceeds 15
characters, so that you get a proper formatted output.
Perform the following tasks: (i) Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase. (ii) Find
the number of vowels and consonants in each word and display them with proper headings
along with the words. 19.
44. Write a program to declare a square matrix A[ ][ ] of order MxM where M is the number
of rows and the number of columns, such that M must be greater than 2 and less than 10.

45. A simple encryption system uses a shifting process to hide a message. The value of the
shift can be in the range 1 to 26. For example a shift of 7 means that A = U, B =V,C = W, etc.
i e. Text : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Code: U V W X Y Z A
B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T Fist an extra space is added to the end of the string.
To make things little more difficult, spaces within the original text are replaced with QQ
before the text is encrypted. Double Q (QQ) was selected because no English word ends in Q
or contains QQ. Additionally the coded message is printed in blocks of six charactersseparated by spaces. The last block might not contain six characters. Write a program that
takes the coded text (less than 100 characters), the shift value and prints the decoded original
text. Your program must reject any non-valid value for shift and display an error message
“INVALID SHIFT VALUE”. Assume all characters are upper case.
Test your program for the following data and some data that you have coded, using the rules
given above:
SAMPLE DATA: 1. INPUT: CODED TEXT: “UHINBY LKKQCH HYLKK” SHIFT: 7
OUTPUT: DECODED TEXT: ANOTHER VALUE 2. INPUT: CODED TEXT: “RUIJGG
EVGGBK SAGG” SHIFT: 11 OUTPUT: DECODED TEST: BEST OF LUCK 3. INPUT:
CODED TEXT: “DKSMMW NAMMUK QMM” SHIFT: 29 OUTPUT: INVALID SHIFT
VAULE.
46. WAP to count vowels, Upper Case Characters and Lower case characters present in the
string.

54. WAP to return highest occurred character in a String?
55. WAP to check if a String is valid shuffle of two String? Suppose You are given 3 strings:
first, second, and third. third String is said to be a shuffle of first and second if it can be
formed by interleaving the characters of first and second String in a way that maintains the
left to right ordering of the characters from each string. For example, given first = "abc" and
second = "def", third = "dabecf" is a valid shuffle since it preserves the character ordering of
the two strings. So, given these 3 strings write a function that detects whether third String is a
valid shuffle of first and second String.
56. Accept a paragraph of text consisting of sentences that are terminated by either „.‟ (full
stop), „!‟ (exclamation mark) or a „?‟ (question mark). Assume that there can be maximum 10
sentences in a paragraph. Write a program to arrange the sentences in increasing order of
their number of words.57. Write a program to declare a square matrix A[][] of order (M x M) where „M‟ must be
greater than 3 and less than 10. Allow the user to input positive integers into this matrix.
Perform the following tasks on the matrix:
( a) Sort the boundary elements in descending order using any standard sorting technique and
rearrange them in the matrix.
(b) Calculate the sum of the boundary elements.
(c) Display the original matrix, rearranged matrix and sum of the boundary elements.
Test your program with the sample data and some random data:

month and generate its calendar.
59. A square matrix is said to be a Magic Square, if the sum of each row, each column and
each diagonal is same. Write a program to enter an integer number „n‟. Create a magic square
of size „n*n‟. Finally, print the elements of the matrix as Magic Square.Note: n <= 5

60. Write a Program in Java to input a 2-D array of size „m*n‟ and print its boundary (border)
elements.
For example:
61. A simple encryption system uses a shifting process to hide a message. The value of the
shift can be in the range 1 to 26. For example a shift of 7 means that A = U, B =V,C = W,
etc.i e.Text : A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Code: U V W X Y Z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T
Fist an extra space is added to the end of the string. To make things little more
difficult, spaces within the original text are replaced with QQ before the text is encrypted.
Double Q (QQ) was selected because no English word ends in Q or contains QQ.
Additionally the coded message is printed in blocks of six characters separated by
spaces. The last block might not contain six characters. Write a program that takes the coded
text (less than 100 characters), the shift value and prints the decoded original text.Your
program must reject any non-valid value for shift and display an error message “INVALID
SHIFT VALUE)”. Assume all characters are upper case. Test your program for the following
data and some data that you have coded, using the rules given above:

62. Write a Program in Java to input a number in Decimal number system and convert it into
its equivalent number in the Binary number system.
Note: Binary Number system is a number system which can represent a number in any other
number system in terms of 0 and 1 only. This number system consists of only two basic digits
i.e. 0 and 1.
For Example: 25 in the Decimal number system can be represented as 11001 in the Binary
number system.Figure Illustrating Decimal to Binary Number System Conversion

(3,5) (5,7) (11,13) (17,19) (29,31) (41,43) (59,61) (71,73)

64. Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique which is implemented as ROT13 („rotate by
13 places‟). It is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13
places after it in the alphabets, with the other characters remaining unchanged.
Write a program to accept a plain text of length L, where L must be greater than 3 and less
than 100.
Encrypt the text if valid as per the Caesar Cipher.

65. A Circular Prime is a prime number that remains prime under cyclic shifts of its digits.
When the leftmost digit is removed and replaced at the end of the remaining string of digits,
the generated number is still prime. The process is repeated until the original number is
reached again.
